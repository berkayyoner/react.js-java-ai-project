    "description": "I graduated from ÃœskÃ¼dar University as a Software Engineer. I started my first full-time IT job at Ã‡elebi Aviation Holding in May 2024. I focus on developing software projects and managing IT processes. I am a social person who likes to collaborate with my colleagues. I provide support for the agreement, inventory and full-stack software development processes of the department I work in, and I was also solely responsible for the budget and payment processes in my IT department. In addition to standard software development processes, I try to benefit all IT processes by taking more responsibility for management processes.",
